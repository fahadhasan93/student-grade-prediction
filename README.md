## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a \`.env.local\` file in the root directory for any environment-specific configurations:

\`\`\`env
# Add any API keys or configuration here
# Currently, no external APIs are required
\`\`\`

### Model Configuration

The prediction algorithm can be customized in \`app/api/predict/route.ts\`:

- **Grade Boundaries**: Adjust percentage thresholds for each grade
- **Weightings**: Modify the importance of different factors
- **Pass Mark**: Change the 40% pass threshold if needed
- **Confidence Levels**: Adjust prediction confidence calculations

## üéÆ Usage Guide

### Basic Usage

1. **Open the application** in your web browser
2. **Fill in student information**:
   - Demographics (age, gender)
   - Family background (income, parent education)
   - Study habits (hours per week, library visits, online usage)
   - Academic scores (CT1, CT2, assignments, presentations, midterm, final)
3. **Click "Predict Grade"** to get results
4. **Review the prediction**:
   - Pass/Fail status
   - Predicted grade and confidence
   - Grade probabilities
   - Score breakdown
   - Personalized recommendations

### Input Guidelines

#### Academic Scores
